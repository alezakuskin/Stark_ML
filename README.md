# StarkML: Machine Learning-based Tool for Predicting Stark Parameters of Atomic Emission Lines

## Description

## Contents

In the present repository you find everything needed to predict Stark broadening parameters for atomic lines of your interest. Currenly, predictions are made by an optimized XGBoost model.

### Please, follow these simple steps to get predicted values:

1. Download Example.xlsx and fill the table with your lines of interest. Fields 'Element', 'Wavelength' and 'Z number' are optional and used for information purposes only. Please, express Energy in $cm^{-1}$ and Temperature in Kelvin.

2. Open Predictions.ipynb notebook. We recommend opening in Coogle Colab. Link to open the notebook in Colab appears on top of the content if you press on the name of notebook. (Correct operation is not guaranteed if you try to run the notebook locally)

3. Follow instructions inside the notebook
